My name is Sajad, and my personality type is INTP, which you can read about [here](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality).
I have been passionate about coding ever
since I was 12 years old. Two of my hobbies are playing chess and watching movies.

As long as I can remember, I have been drawn to solving challenging problems, particularly those that are difficult to solve. I first became interested in programming because I wanted to understand how it worked, and I continue to learn something new every day.

As a Flutter developer, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from mobile apps to web applications, and I have come to appreciate the versatility and flexibility of the platform. Whether I am developing a simple app or a complex enterprise-level solution, I always strive to deliver the best possible user experience and to create a product that people will love to use.

In addition to my technical skills and expertise, I am also highly collaborative and enjoy working closely with my clients to translate their vision into a working product. I take great pride in delivering high-quality work on time and on budget, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and develop my skills.

If you are looking for a passionate, dedicated, and highly skilled Flutter developer who can help you bring your ideas to life, then I would love to hear from you. Whether you need a simple app or a complex enterprise-level solution, I am confident that I have the skills and expertise needed to deliver the results you are looking for.
