VS Code is popular code editor among developers.

Using VS Code extensions, We have the chance to add more functionalities to this editor than just being a code editor.

If you are using VS Code you probably already have installed common extensions like Git and Prettier so I will skip them.

## 1. Git Graph

This is a helpful extension that let's you see the Git history in a fancy way. Git's desktop app already has this feature
but you will need an extension to use it in VS Code.

All you need to do is to [install it](todo) and then navigate to a git project and click on Git Graph text on bottom bar of the VS Code.

Here you can see Git Graph of [Flutter repo](todo) (Blue line is the main branch)

## 2. VS Code Google Translate

I personally love this one, It translate raw texts in VS Code using a simple, fast and free api.

After [installing it](todo), Go to a file and select a text, Then open command pallete and type translate,
Select `Transalte selection(s)` and select the target language.

It will help you when you are using a foreign api, Or when you want a simple translation for your app.

## 3. WakaTime

This one is actually a work time tracking extension and it tracks your coding time,
You need to register on [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) and then [install extension](https://wakatime.com/vs-code) on VS Code.
After providing the API Key from it's website, It will start working and sends data to your [dashboard](https://wakatime.com/dashboard)
